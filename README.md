## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the ISAP-3 (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal modifications, so that the instruction format remains the same but uses a serial processor.

## ISAP-7 version 1.0
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the ISAP-3 computer. To do this, we need to go through the steps that we followed for its design.

Version 1.0 will be an implementation of the ISAP-3 computer that is as close to the original as possible. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.
